T﻿he last 10 years, I've learned so much in my job/life. Well learned, I have experienced a lot, potentially learned, but also lots forgotten (**which means I haven't learned it)**. 

> "﻿[P﻿eople underestimate how much they will change in 10 years](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_psychology_of_your_future_self)"; I certainly have noticed that.

I﻿ am starting to look for ways to consolidate my learning, and also sharing them. A website will be a place to do 'all in one': by writing my personal skills development down, putting it on a website, I could retrieve it myself. Plus, others could read it.

Having found the Wowchemy website and them being open source, I was interested.  It closely aligns to my current interest in open access, transparency and open source things, where one shares what they know so that others can benefit. 

Building/starting a website is also a new skill. I have explored and feel I understand the basic process, and how to change/add stuff, both via Netlify/Wowchemy, and directly in GitHub, where the website is stored.  

Then the structure..... I feel this website is 3 things:

1. **Showcase my research**
2. **Give insight into my teaching (philosophy)**
3. **S﻿hare with the (local) community.**

H﻿ence the current website name: Marco (me), WARU is the Well-being and health Assessment Research Unit which I feel most affiliated to, and SES stands for Sport and Exercise Science, the degree I contribute the most to at Aberystwyth University. 

T﻿he way to go is to describe what I get up to and to produce that for example in the form of resources, guides, tutorials, and other ways of dissemination.

A﻿ssuming I will keep developing myself, this website will have heaps of contents in 10 years time!
