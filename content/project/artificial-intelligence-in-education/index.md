Y﻿es, i don't want students to use AI to replace their own knowledge, but blimey, loads of tools can make it more efficient to learn, gain knowledge and produce higher quality reports/writing/coding/analyses/reviews.

L﻿earn more about ways I think you could benefit. I'm by no means an expert, but have an inquisitive mind and happy to share my thoughts.
