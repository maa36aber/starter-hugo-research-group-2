  * O﻿penCap, that does 3D motion capture with the use of 2 or more Apple devices (tablet or phone) and provides the traditional kinematic data of the whole body.

Although 3D motion capture is very accurate (able to detect changes of around 1 mm), it is outdated. Recent developments are less about quality, but more about ease and applicability. Video is everywhere and with new machine learning techniques, becoming almost automated to analyse motion. 

This guide will explore options to make motion analysis available to the mainstream public. Yes, with a learning curve and still requires expertise, skill and equipment, but not as much/high as for the 3D motion capture system that I normally use(d).
